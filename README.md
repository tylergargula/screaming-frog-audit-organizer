# Screaming Frog Tech Audit Prioritization

This project aims to create a prioritized list of issues from Screaming Frog's tech audit using a custom prioritization algorithm. The algorithm labels issues based on factors such as traffic, issue type, priority, and issue scale.

## Introduction
This notebook processes and prioritizes issues identified by Screaming Frog's tech audit. It leverages Google Search Console (GSC) data to enhance the prioritization process.

## Data Import
The notebook imports issues overview and GSC data from CSV files:
- `data/issues_overview_report.csv`
- `data/search_console_all.csv`

## Data Cleaning
The `clean_data` function merges and cleans the issues data with GSC data, preparing it for further analysis.

## Data Labeling
The `label_data` function labels the cleaned data based on a custom prioritization algorithm.

## Data Visualization
The notebook provides various visualizations to help understand the distribution and impact of issues:
- Distribution plot based on Impact Score
- Bar plots for top percentiles of clicks and URL counts

## Exporting Data
The `export_data` function exports the processed data to an Excel file with multiple sheets, categorized by priority.

## Clustering Issues
The notebook includes optional steps to cluster issues and visualize them in a 2D space using embeddings generated by a pre-trained model.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- plotly
- sentence-transformers
- scikit-learn
- openpyxl

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required packages.
3. Run the notebook `sf_audit_organizer.ipynb` to process and visualize the data.
